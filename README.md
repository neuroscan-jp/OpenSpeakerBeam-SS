# OpenSpeakerBeam-SS: Real-time Target Speaker Extraction with Lightweight Conv-TasNet and State Space Modeling

This is an **independent implementation** of [SpeakerBeam-SS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01857), a real-time target speaker extraction model combining lightweight Conv-TasNet and State Space Modeling (S4D). The goal is to achieve efficient and high-performance speaker separation on resource-constrained devices.

🚨 **Disclaimer:** This repository is **not affiliated** with the authors of the original paper. It is an independent reimplementation and may have differences from the paper's methodology. If you have suggestions for improvements, feel free to share them! 🚨

## ✅ Project Status

The **network model implementation, training, and test dataset preparation are complete**. A full training cycle has been conducted using datasets published on Hugging Face, and test results are available. Some architectural differences from the original paper may exist. Feedback and pull requests are welcome.

## 📖 Reference

- **Paper:** [SpeakerBeam-SS: Real-time Target Speaker Extraction with Lightweight Conv-TasNet and State Space Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01857)

## 📌 Features

- Conv-TasNet-based architecture with **S4D blocks** for efficient temporal modeling
- **Multiplicative adaptation** with d-vector speaker embeddings
- **1D convolutional blocks** for feature extraction
- **ONNX Runtime support** for CPU acceleration (AVX2 / AVX-512) — see [`onnx-runtime/`](onnx-runtime/) (Rust 推論ツリー)
- **Designed for real-time inference** on mobile and server environments

## 🔧 Installation

### Dependencies

Install required dependencies with:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 🔊 Inference

Run speaker extraction on a given mixture and enrollment audio:

```sh
python inference.py \
  --mixture data/sample/mixture_000001.wav \
  --enrollment data/sample/enrollment_000001.wav \
  --output data/sample/result_000001.wav
```

### 🏋️ Training

```sh
python train.py --mode=train
```

### 🧪 Testing

```sh
python train.py --mode=test
```

Training and testing CSV metadata files are automatically downloaded and stored from Hugging Face:

```text
--train_csv data_csv/train/metadata.csv
--dev_csv   data_csv/dev/metadata.csv
--test_csv  data_csv/test/metadata.csv
```

## 💾 Dataset & Checkpoints

- ✅ **Test dataset and pretrained model available on Hugging Face:**  
  https://huggingface.co/datasets/helloidea/OpenSpeakerBeam-SS-dataset/tree/main

- ✅ **Pretrained model:** `checkpoints/best_model.pth`

- 🔍 **[Test] Test Loss (SI-SNR): -5.8925**  
  *(Note: current performance is modest; improvements are planned.)*

- Evaluation result samples:

[enrollment audio 1](data/sample/enrollment_000001.wav)
[mixture audio 1](data/sample/mixture_000001.wav)
[result audio 1](data/sample/result_000001.wav)

[enrollment audio 2](data/sample/enrollment_000002.wav)
[mixture audio 2](data/sample/mixture_000002.wav)
[result audio 2](data/sample/result_000002.wav)

## 💡 Performance

Initial FLOP measurements on 1-second input (16kHz):

```
FLOPs: 21.60G, Params: 7.64M
```

- Expected to run **in real-time on modern CPUs** with **AVX2 or AVX-512** optimizations.
- **Neon acceleration** planned for **iOS devices** via ONNX Runtime.

## 📌 TODO

- Validate output quality
- Optimize model for mobile deployment
